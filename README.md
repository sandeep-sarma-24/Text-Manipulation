# React Text Convertor

This is a React-based application that provides two utilities for text conversion - a Uppercase Convertor and a Lowercase Convertor. It allows you to input text and convert it to either all uppercase or all lowercase. It also provides a summary of your input text, counting the number of words and characters, and giving an estimated read time.

## Usage

The application presents two components, TextForm and TextForm2. 

- TextForm is an uppercase convertor. It contains a text area for input, a button to convert the text to uppercase, and another button to clear the text. 
- TextForm2 is a lowercase convertor. It functions similarly to TextForm but converts the text to lowercase.

Each component also provides a summary of the input text, including word count, character count, and estimated reading time.
